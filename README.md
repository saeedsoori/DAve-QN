This is the implementation of paper **DAve-QN: A Distributed Averaged Quasi-Newton Method with Local
Superlinear Convergence Rate**, accepted at the 23rd International Conference on
Artificial Intelligence and Statistics ([AISTATS-2020](https://www.aistats.org/ )). 

We also provide a high performance implementatation of state-of-the-art methods [GIANT](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7501-giant-globally-improved-approximate-newton-method-for-distributed-optimization.pdf), [DAve-RPG](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/mishchenko18a/mishchenko18a.pdf) and [DANE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.7853.pdf) for comparision.
